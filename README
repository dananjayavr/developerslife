This is a short Python script I wrote to listen to the awesome developer's life podcasts
at, http://thisdeveloperslife.com/

This program will parse the RSS feed of thie website and list all the available episodes
in the command prompt. Then it will invoke the VLC media player to play the files while 
simultaneosly streaming them.

If you don't have VLC Player installed, you can alter the source code to add any media
player of your choice.

Just run this program,

$ python developerslife.py

like that and from then on, everything will be self-explainatory.
